# 1.Olist E-commerece Dataset →

### Problem Statement →

## **1. Customer Churn & Retention →**

Olist faces high variability in customer buying frequency—many first-time customers never return. This limits long-term revenue and increases acquisition costs. The objective is to analyze customer behavior, order patterns, delivery performance, and review scores to identify the key drivers of customer churn and build a data-driven retention strategy.

Q → Why do customers not return?

---

## **2. Delivery Performance Optimization →**

**Problem Statement:**

Late deliveries negatively impact customer satisfaction and review scores on the Olist marketplace. The goal is to analyze delivery times, distance, logistics delays, and product categories to identify the factors causing delivery delays and propose actionable improvements to reduce delivery time variance.

Q → What causes delivery delays?

---

## **3. Review Score Impact Analysis →**

**Problem Statement:**

Customer reviews directly influence seller reputation and long-term sales on the platform. However, many products receive low ratings due to unclear expectations, delivery issues, or product problems. The objective is to investigate the drivers of low review scores and quantify how different factors—delivery delay, product category, payment method, price range—affect review outcomes.

Q → What leads to low review scores?

# 2.Synthea Healthcare Dataset →

### Problem Statement →

## **1. Patient Readmission & Care Quality →**

Hospitals often struggle with patients returning within a short period after discharge, increasing operational load and lowering care quality. Using Synthea’s encounter, conditions, medications, and procedure records, the goal is to identify the key factors driving early readmissions and evaluate how care plans or treatment paths influence patient outcomes.

**Q → Why do patients get readmitted?**

---

## **2. Treatment Effectiveness & Condition Progression →**

Not all treatments produce the same outcomes for all patients. With medication, observation, and procedure data, the objective is to analyze how different treatment plans affect recovery patterns, condition outcomes, and time to improvement.

**Q → Which treatments work better for which conditions?**

---

## **3. Hospital Utilization & Resource Load Analysis →**

Hospitals must balance patient volume, encounter types, provider workloads, and length-of-stay. Using encounters, providers, and organization tables, the goal is to identify bottlenecks, high-load departments, and operational inefficiencies.

**Q → Where do hospitals face the highest workload and why?**

# 3.Open University Learning Analytics Dataset →

### Problem Statement →

## **1. Student Dropout & Retention Analysis →**

Many students register for courses but fail to complete them. This results in lower pass rates and wasted academic resources. Using student demographics, course registrations, assessments, and VLE activity logs, the goal is to identify the factors that lead to student dropout or withdrawal.

**Q → Why do students drop out or stop engaging?**

---

## **2. Learning Engagement & Performance Prediction →**

Students interact differently with learning materials. Some spend more time on VLE content, while others rely mostly on assessments. The objective is to analyze how VLE activity patterns relate to assessment scores and overall performance, and determine early indicators of at-risk students.

**Q → How does engagement affect student performance?**

---

## **3. Course Structure & Assessment Impact Analysis →**

Different modules have different assignment schedules, assessment types, and difficulty levels. The goal is to evaluate how course structure and assessment patterns influence student outcomes, pass rates, and workload distribution.

**Q → Which course or assessment designs help students succeed?**
